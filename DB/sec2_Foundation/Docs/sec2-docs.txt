Foundation of SQL

  - SQL: Structured Query Language.

  - SQL is a declarative language.
    - Declarative means, something is GOING to happen.. get data back from the database.
      So we are stating something that is going to happen. We say WHAT will happen, but 
      we have no idea how its happening.

    - Imperative programming. Meaning HOW it will happen. where we go line by line
      saying how it will happen.

  - A language to query and manipulate data stored in relational databases.
  - A relational DBs contains tables.
  - Strong mathematical foundation.
  - SQL is based on the relational model, which in turn is based on Set Theory 
    and Predicate Logic.
  - The relational model is a mathematical model for data management and manipulation.
  - SQL was first created by Ted Codd in 1969 and is the cornerstone of SQL 
    and relational databases.
  - Iteration: a process where a set of instructions are repeated a specified number of 
    times, or until a condition is met.
  - In relational data, it is best to use relational operations that work with whole 
    tables at a time.
  - Predicate condition in SQl, a condition that either returns true of false. 
   

Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
 - RDBMS is a way to access and connect the the database.
 - MSSQL, MySQL, PostgresSQL, Oracle Database, SQLite are example of popular (RDBMS) 
   that use SQL to interact with DBs.

Tables
 - Tables holds the data, whiles DBs holds tables.
 - A table is a collection of related data held in a structured
  format within a database.

  Query
   - An SQL statement to retrieve data from a database.
   - How the SQL engine decides to execute a query is what we call a query plan.
   - The query plan affects the efficiency of the query.
